# Python skills
Python skills I have learned so far.
My skills are displayed in little projects I made during my Python course in my studies. 
The projects are briefly described down below

 
  1) Fille handling - preparing a file with DNA sequences 
  
  2a) Comparing the counts of nucelotides between two random DNA sequences
  
  2b) Comparing counts of nucleotide hits between multiple random DNA sequences and plot through matplotlib and numpy
  
  3) Coding a nummerical integrator for solving differential equations

  4) Digesting DNA sequence consequently with two restriction enzymes 

  5) A short self-made module with functions
  
  6) Extract useful genome data from a text file
