Python skills I have learnd so far displayed, which are displayed in little projects
The projects are briefly described in this "README"

 
  1) Fille handling - preparing a file with DNA sequences for the following mini-projects
  
  2a) Comparing the counts of nucelotides between two random DNA sequences
  
  2b) Comparing counts of nucleotide hits between multiple random DNA sequences and plot through matplotlib and numpy
  
  3) Coding a nummerical integrator for solving differential equations

  4) Digesting DNA sequence with two restriction enzymes consequently

  5) A short self-made module with functions
